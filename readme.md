This artifact contains the files used in SemSeed's replication. As mentioned in the article, the necessary files for running SemSeed can be found [here](https://github.com/sola-st/SemSeed/)

The "Sample Files" folder has the input files which were each placed in SemSeed's "\benchmarks\data" folder, substituting the default file "sample.js"

The Selected Files folder contains the code fragments which were used in the survey. These fragments are from files generated by SemSeed, and each one has the associated Similarity from the JSON file.

The script "search_similarity.py" was used to divide the total output in four quartiles divided by similarity and choose one random file from each quartile, while "similarity_display.py" shows graphs of an output's similarity distribution.

"[Final] Survey on Synthetic Bugs for JavaScript.xlsx" has the survey's data and all calculations displayed as tables throughout the article.

We also provide a directory with example files that, for any reason, SemSeed could not seed bugs in
